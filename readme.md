## Introduction
This modification adds a BBCode to view clips from **[nobbc]XBoxClips.com[/nobbc]** and **[nobbc]XBoxDVR.com[/nobbc]** videos and pictures.

The BBCodes takes these forms:
    
    [xboxdvr]{xboxdvr URL}[/xboxdvr]
    [xboxdvr width=x height=x]{xboxdvr URL}[/xboxdvr]
    [xboxclips]{xboxclips URL}[/xboxclips]
    [xboxclips width=x height=x]{xboxclips URL}[/xboxclips]
    

## Admin Settings
There are two new settings on the **Modifications Settings** page:
- XBox default width
- XBox default height

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.11, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 2, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

This mod should be installed after [Tapatalk mod](https://www.tapatalk.com/download_SimpleMachines.php), if you want to use it with Tapatalk.
